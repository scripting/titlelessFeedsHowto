Per jz's <a href="https://github.com/scripting/titlelessFeedsHowto/issues/1#issue-1488841784">suggestion</a>, when splitting an titleless item's text, if there is a sentence at the beginning of the text which is short enough, use the sentence text instead of truncating after the end of the sentence. In other words, the sentence end is a more natural place to break the text. 

Added a period at the end of an actual title. Looks much better to separate it from the excerpt text that follows.
